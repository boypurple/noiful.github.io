                Goal: World domination, terrorise everyone.

        </div><h4>Section One: Geography</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Tche'et is mostly home to Arcanians who find the smell of fear to be euphoric. The architecture is nearly identical to Squee-et's, except that it has far more nasty barbed wire, spikes and skulls of enemies enladen into walls and pillars. Their wizard spires run impossibly tall, and are wider on the inside than the outside.</p>
    <h4>Section Two: Culture</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Tche'eti Arcanains are usually extremely cruel. They regularly steal candy from babies and step on cats. They have a fondness for magic, and hate technology. They view their nation as superior, because they are the most powerful by virtue of magic. Of course, Squee-et has equally powerful magic, but Squee-et isn't willing to wipe an entire nation off the map with a nuclear magic missle, so that complicates things.</p>
     <h4>Section Three: Significance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Tche'et is a member of the Inner Circle Treaty League. They cooperate with Nobleshire, its only other member (save for a few opportunist Bricklandish warlord-states), but intend to also destroy them someday. Slowly and painfully, like everyone else.</p>
