        </div><h4>Section One: The Zhesh Condition</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Zhesh have a constant need for destruction, or they will become insane and destroy even more. It is not uncommon for Zhesh toddlers to have developed a penchant for killing small bugs, and as children, they often target rodents. Zhesh teenagers sometimes kill larger animals such as cats and dogs, and adults can be homicidal. In modern Zhesh society, most Zhesh refrain from killing as much as they can so that the addiction does not build. They create art that involves the shattering of glass, the scattering of paint, and they love smashing their instruments at the end of a concert (which is why they often only employ cheap instruments.)</p>
    <h4>Section Two: Appearance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Zhesh usually stand slightly taller than humans on average, and they are usually of a wider build than humans. They all have artificial light sources for heads, whether it be a desk lamp or a street lantern or otherwise. They are usually made of brass, copper or tin, albeit there are those made of other metals.</p>
     <h4>Section Three: Significance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Zhesh were built as robots built to serve the humans of Nobleshire. Many were conscipted as knights in the five-centuries war, and as a result, they became quite violent, and very good at killing at that. They were all exiled from Nobleshire, and soon began to tire of violence, and formed communities of their own, using their need for destruction as a creative outlet rather than as a violent one. They really like target shooting and martial arts as well! Oh, all those wasted pumpkins!</p>
