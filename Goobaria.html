        </div><h4>Section One: Geography</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Goobarian zoning has got to be the worst zoning possible. Some districts are extremely optimized and organized, with little room to breathe, and others are a mismatch of datacenters, factories, farms, powerplants, park districts, forest preserves, residential areas, banks, fine dining, fast food and computer stores. However, their architecture is very colorful.</p>
    <h4>Section Two: Culture</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Goobarians are mostly human, though there are some Ekish in the country as well. Goobaria is a land of misfits, those who do not fit into any society and wish to fit in amongst similar people. Many of them greet each other without making eye contact, and it is normal to arrive late to a meeting (yes, even later than Mayisdans), because one forgot about it. Those who are not considered misfits who live there do not judge them for it, either. They like colorful things, mostly, and enjoy a large amount of whimsy that some would consider excessive.</p>
     <h4>Section Three: Significance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Goobaria is a member of the Outer Ring Alliance, along with Ellenet (sometimes, because Ellenet comes and goes), Mayisda, Squee-et, and most of The Bricklands. Anyone can become a Goobarian resident, but Goobarian citizenship is earned by being silly and whimsical.</p>
