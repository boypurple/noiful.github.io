        </div><h4>Section One: The Human Condition</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Human Condition would be too difficult (or indeed, impossible) to describe in its entirety here. To briefly sum up who human beings are as people who are born with the instinct of empathy (as are all social-minded species), and have some concept of moralilty (much like the Squetch-Arcanians.) The evolutionary purpose of their kindness is survival in groups, as they aren't particularly strong, though they do have a most impressive mental fortitude. If one were to ask a human why they are kind, however, they would be unable to provide a logical reason such as the aforemnetioned one. To them, it is instinct, it is innate. They feel bad when not abiding by those rules, with the exception of those who make further logic out of their morality to justify actions that their peers would find most deplorable.</p>
    <h4>Section Two: Appearance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Humans appear as apes with significantly less hair. They are bipedal, and skinnier than most apes. They appear in several shades of brown, from near-white peachy to near-black chocolate, sometimes with a slight tinge of yellow or red. Their appearnce differs based on biological sex in terms of shape. They wear clothes that differ greatly based on environment or personal prefernce, as well as cultural factors.</p>
     <h4>Section Three: Significance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Humans are the best chefs on the planets, and all the good recipies come from them, such as the palabok pancit of Mayisda, or the hamburgers of Nobleshire. Being the least magical race, they are also the most inventive and clever with technology. Also, there are quite a few that are pleasant to talk to! Most of them, however, are not.</p>
