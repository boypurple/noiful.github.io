            <h3>Government: Dictatorship<br>
                Current Leader: King Steiner<br>
                Goal: Maintain traditional status quo, conquer Goobaria, steal the sun.
            </h3>
        </div><h4>Section One: Geography</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Nobleshire has expansive verdant hills and plains with cloudy to lightly rainy weather, and scarcely thunderstorms, but never sun. There are floating castles high above the land, surrounded by a magical force field where the royalty live. Beyond that is a lower set of mansions that house the nobles, lower than that are the knight barracks, then the peasant appartment blocks and hydroponic farms, followed finally by serfs, who live on the ground with all the trash from the above districts.</p>
    <h4>Section Two: Culture</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Nobleshire has extremely traditional values, and has not changed their social class structre in over five-thousand years, though other parts of their society have changed. They expect people to stick to their class in most affairs. Their population is entirely human, and they are all expected to fit into the norms of how the majority of people socially interact, though that is not to say they are intolerant of other cultures (other than The Goobarians.) Other races are not forbidden from this nation, but their presence there is very rare. Anti-mages (guns) are forbidden here, even though Nobleshire has the best technology on the planet. For this reason, most who carry weapons opt for magnet-swords. Magic is outlawed there as well, and some scholars of this nation debate on whether or not to ban quantum computers, arguing that these computers are a form of "magic." That's false, of course. What do these guys know?</p>
     <h4>Section Three: Significance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Nobleshire is one of only two nations to have a religion (the other nation being Mayisda.) In their religion, the gods are not worshipped as they are in Mayisda, but moreso hated. To power their massive AI datacenters, and to spite the gods, they intend on stealing the sun. Of course, the gods don't really care if they steal the sun or not, because they don't really give a shit about anything, anywhere, ever. In the five-centuries-war, they created the most casualties out of all the non-magical militaries on Noiful-Planeth. They claim that Goobaria is also their land, and intend to conquer it at some point whenever the king finds peace to be overwhelmingly boring.</p>
