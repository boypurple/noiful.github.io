        </div><h4>Section One: Geography</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Squee-et is mostly home to Arcanians who find the smell of fear to be awful. The architecture is nearly identical to Tche'et's, except that it has nowhere near the amount of nasty barbed wire or spikes or skulls of enemies enladen into walls and pillars. Their wizard spires run impossibly tall, and are taller on the inside than the outside.</p>
    <h4>Section Two: Culture</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Squee-eti Arcanains are usually extremely empathetic. They leave their doors open and invite strangers in for tea. They have a fondness for magic, but do not reject technology. Due to their relations with both The Bricklands and Mayisda, they have a fond taste for both lumpia and alumpiapihan, though they cannot tell the difference between the two when the alumpiapihan is stripped of its legs. Many of the Mayisdan diaspora within The Bricklands tend to take offense to this, but most of the other diaspora and Mayisdan populace don't care as much.</p>
     <h4>Section Three: Significance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">Squee-et is known for having the highest hospitality index among any nation within Noiful-Planeth, with the lowest being their neighbor to the north, Tche'et. They also are tied with Tche'et for having the highest magical index out of any nation in the world.</p>
