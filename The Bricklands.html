        </div><h4>Section One: Geography</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Bricklands are entirely made of bricks, for the most part. There is no flora of fauna, other than the alumpiapihan, which are small Mayisdan eggrolls (known as lumpia), that have one hundred legs (fifty on each side) and two sets of antenae (four total.) If one were to remove a brick from the ground, it would make a hissing sound, and then another brick would magically materialize and take its place.</p>
    <h4>Section Two: Culture</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Bricklands is the most culturally diverse region on Noiful-Planeth. Multiple human cultures live here, such as the Bayangsingawans and the Kulamiyans of Mayisda, as well as the Ellenese from Ellen-et, the Goobarians of Goobaria, and the Shiric of Nobleshire. There are also many original human cultures here derived from those diaspora. Both Squee-eti Arcanians and Tche'eti Arcanians are here as well, along with their diaspora. The Ekish don't have a single unifying culture, but rather adopt other cultures as their own, but they are the most numerous population in this nation.</p>
     <h4>Section Three: Significance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Bricklands have several regional wizard-warlords that populate the towers. There are buildings made almost entirely of bricks mixed in with materials from elsewhere, and foreign architecture. The marketplaces are large, and the quality of their goods varies greatly. They have long, non-euclidean magitech trains that are made of bricks that can transport one nearly anywhere in The Bricklands, but also into Nobleshire and Goobaria to a certain extent. Alumpiapihan are their only food, which has meat, vegtables and wrapping. Mayisdan merchants who make real lumpia are quite miffed by this, as you can probably tell. Bricklanders are known to scream at the gods more than anyone else out of anger.</p>
