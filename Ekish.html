        </div><h4>Section One: The Ekish Condition</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Ekish were made by the gods of Noiful-Planeth for the sole purpose of being a punching bags for the rest of Noiful-Planeth. Their lives are much longer than humans (who have the second longest lifespan of Noiful-Planeth other than The Analog,) but it is filled with near constant misery. Ekish are always depressed in winters and summers with no exceptions. They are tormented by near-constant hallucinations in the first twenty years of their lives, and while they are highly intelligent and empathetic, they lack some physical strength (though they are still stronger than Arcanians on average, and actually have the second-highest magic index of all races on the planet.)</p>
    <h4>Section Two: Appearance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Ekish either stand at precisely four feet tall or seven feet tall. There is no inbetween. They are usually fairly lanky, and they have pointy ears, and larger than average skulls for holding knowledge, though it gets in the way of their physical endeavors. They are most similar to Humans in appearance out of the races of Noiful-Planeth, and have the same set of colors.</p>
     <h4>Section Three: Significance</h4><p style = "text-indent: 15px;"class = "w3-left-align w3-sand">The Ekish have withstood the test of time and cruelty for generations. The gods had made and forsaken them as a one-off joke, but they did not fall. Even in the five-century-years war, they clung to life and intended to fight to their last using guerilla warfare. The tall ones weilded spears, the short ones wielded magic, and those who weren't particularly good at fighting with either manufactured, invented, and used their own anti-mages (an invention identical to guns in our world, but with rounds that can penetrate magical defenses.) They have a hard time building emotional and mental boundaries, but they fail quickly, and learn even more quickly.</p>
